/**
 * @summary A short script that is only run on the production version of the page
 * 
 * Because I have the production version of this page on my website (which is
 * in a separate directory from the version that is on Github), I made this to
 * give me a reminder that I need to migrate things from the development 
 * directory (e.g. HunterRatliff1/BugDrug) to the production directory. It also
 * makes the disclaimer modal run upon loading the page.
 * 
 * The idea is to not update this script in the development directory (i.e. keep
 * the functions in document ready commented out) and not copy it over to 
 * production when you copy over the other ones. That way, the page looks 
 * different in production until you've finalized everything (at which point
 * you can delete this)
